Difference between Vue and Express

It seems like the Express code is more about code that's related to the server whereas the Vue code takes care of the functionality of the app, i.e. what to do when the client changes the present checkbox or when the client adds a new student or when a user is deleted. The Express code is more oriented with how these actions that the client executes will talk to the Express server and database. Creating routers for the api server in the student-sign-in for example. api.js creates POST, GET, PATCH, etc. requests that will be able to communicate with the Vue code in the Student Store that will tell the app exactly what to do to the Server database/ api server. So if a user adds a new student. A POST request is made to add a new student to the database. Or if a PATCH request is made via HTTPie, the express code talks to the api server to edit an existing student's data. Express code also looks like it takes care of error handling. Whether it be an error caused by the client, or something external like unable to connect to the database.
